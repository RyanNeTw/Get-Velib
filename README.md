### This project I devlopped in JavaScript, allows anyone to see the main informations about velibs in the Parmentier street in Paris. It first shows you a loading bar representing the percentage of velibs available in the street compared to the total number of charging stations. Then it shows you the exact number of velibs available (in green if the percentage is greater than the third of the total of charging borns, in red in the other case). You can also see the percentage of eVelibs (electric ones) and mechanical velibs. There is also a small map to know exactly where is the street.
